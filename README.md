# üöÄ  Civic Quest: Rebuild the Future
_Empowering Citizens to Rebuild a Sustainable Future Through Interactive 2D Governance and Collaboration Dashboards._

---

## üìå Problem Statement
**Problem Statement 12 ‚Äì Redesign Crisis Logistics and Relief Distribution**

---

## üéØ Objective
_Civic Quest: Rebuild the Future solves the problem of limited citizen involvement in urban decision-making and city management. It serves players who want to engage in rebuilding and managing a sustainable city. By using a 2D dashboard interface, the project provides a platform for users to participate in governance, track city metrics, and make decisions that impact the environment, health, and infrastructure, all while encouraging collaboration. This offers an engaging way for citizens to understand and influence the future of their cities._

### Our Approach

#### Why We Chose This Problem:
We believe that civic engagement and urban sustainability are two of the most important challenges today. Yet, most people feel disconnected from city planning and governance. We chose this problem to bridge that gap by using interactive technology to educate and empower citizens through a gamified yet meaningful experience.

#### Key Challenges We Addressed:
- Designing fully 2D dashboard interfaces that are engaging without relying on animations.
- Integrating blockchain elements like wallet connection, CitizenNFT minting, and DAO voting into simple static panels.
- Making real-time city metrics and crisis events understandable through clean visuals and interactive dashboards.
- Ensuring user collaboration features (like debates, townhalls, and voting) worked intuitively without video or animation-based tools.

#### Pivots, Brainstorms, and Breakthroughs:
- Initially planned a more animation-heavy game but pivoted to a 2D dashboard approach to simplify development and improve clarity.
- Introduced a modular layout where each dashboard acts as a standalone interface with smooth navigation links between them.
- Realized the power of using blockchain not just for tokens, but for real civic participation and transparent decision logs.
- Breakthrough moment: Designing the "Crisis Management Dashboard" with a static decision-tree model helped visualize complex emergencies without animation.
